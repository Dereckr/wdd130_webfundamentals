    <h2>Dereck Romero</h2>
    <p> 
        My name is Dereck, I don't have a nick-name. I am pursuing a degree in Software Development. I am not sure yet if I would like to work in front end or back end.
        But I felt that I have some abilities for programming and I like to do it. I will give all my effort to be a good Software Engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am married for 5 years and have 2 little boys in my family. I love to spend time with them. I am petroleum engineer, but I think that the career I am pursuing will fit better with my goals.
    </p>
    <p>I speak 4 different languages, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese and English. I lived with my wife in Japan for almost 4 years, I like to meet different cultures there is so much to learn from each culture.</p>
    <p> Nice to meet you all! Thank you for looking to my web page.</p>
