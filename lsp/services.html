            <h4>What is a FCL </h4>
            <p> The short form FCL in shipping stands for the term 'Full Container Load'. This means that a shipment occupies the entire space of a container, without having to share it with other shippers.</p>
            <h4>What is a LCL </h4>
            <p>LCL shipping is a method of shipment where your cargo doesn't fill a full container, in other words, it takes up 'less than a container load'. LCL shipping allows your goods to share container space with other small shipments to make up a full container between them. This way, you only pay for the space you use.</p>
