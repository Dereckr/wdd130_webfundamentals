      <p>Companies or natural persons that require to import or export goods. They need this service in a secure, and organized way, so they can reduce costs and get them on the right time. Many times, the final prices for the service are much higher than those agreed, and the estimated time of arrival of their products is very different from what was expected, so they need to have more certainty in these parameters. They will use desktop, laptop, and mobile devices.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        General information about the company.-
        People would like to come to my site to have a general idea about the company. Because of the name, I think they would already know that is a logistics company, but I think they would like to know about the company itself, and its time in the market, so they know about the experience the company already has in the logistics area.<br>
        <br>Company’s social media.-
        The visitors will expect to find information about social media related to the company, like LinkedIn or Facebook. This is really important nowadays LinkedIn shows a professional look of the company and Facebook has a more friendly side of the company.

      </ul>
      <h3>Contact us</h3>
      <p>
        Main office and phone number.-
        The site should answer questions about the location of the main building of the company, and also contact phone number and work hours of these offices. I think this will make feel the customer more confident about the company and also will let the customer know about the convenient locations of the company.<br><br>
        Agents’ contact information for immediate communication.-
        The site should show the customer contact information related to the company, even contact information about agents that can help them to receive a quotation, or give them information about what they need to have their goods transported. This contact information should have the phone number, emails, and a link that enables the client to write or call the agents via WhatsApp.<br><br>
        Office Holidays.-
        The site will have information about holidays and dates when the office will be closed.

      <h3>Services</h3>
      <p>
        Services
        Company’s achievements.-
        The site will have information and images of big projects the company was able to handle, this would give an idea to the visitors about the expertise of the company. I think this is really important because this elevates the reliability of the company in a big way.<br><br>
        Company’s services.-
        The visitors will expect to find information about the services the company offers. Each service will be explained briefly and concisely so it is easy for the customer to understand. Most of the visitors will be people that need to import or export a good but are not experts in logistics.<br><br>
        FAQ.-
        This site will have a section for frequently asked questions so the visitors can clarify some doubts by just getting into the site.

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        I am planning input the social media images in the footer because I think it will be better to have those in every page.
      </p>
      <img src="images/home_wireframe.png" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>Contact us</h3>
      <p>         
        On the top it will be the Main office location and phone numbers. In the bottom the agents contacts. The images at the right of the agents information I plan to put and icon with a link to contact the agents.
      </p>

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>         
        I am a little worried about this page. It seems to have to much information. Because of that I will make each section as concise as possible.
